Project Name: Logarithmic Graphing and Binary-Decimal Conversion in C#

Description:
This project is a mathematical exploration tool developed in C# that incorporates logarithmic graphing functionalities and binary-to-decimal conversion. The project consists of three forms, each focusing on different aspects of mathematical operations and visualizations.

Files:
1. Form1.cs - Logarithmic Graphing
   - Features a textbox to input mathematical equations
   - Generates a graph based on the entered equation
   - Displays the differences in the graph and the variations in X and Y values

2. Form2.cs - Logarithm Calculator
   - Allows users to take logarithms on different bases
   - Provides the ability to study the impact of varying the base on the resulting value

3. Form3.cs - Binary-to-Decimal Converter
   - Enables conversion from binary to decimal
   - Offers a step-by-step visualization of the conversion process

Additional Materials:
- Presentation: Provides insights into the history of logarithms, their practical applications in daily life, and more.
  
Usage Instructions:
1. Open the project in a C# environment or Run the project using the included run.exe .
2. Each form focuses on distinct mathematical operations:
   - Form1: Graphs equations and visualizes differences in graphs and values.
   - Form2: Calculates logarithms with variable bases for analysis.
   - Form3: Converts binary numbers to their decimal equivalents with a step-by-step view.
3. Utilize the textbox inputs, buttons, and visual representations to explore mathematical concepts.

Notes:
- The project aims to assist in understanding logarithmic concepts, graphing equations, and binary-decimal conversions.
- The accompanying presentation provides supplementary information about logarithms and their practical significance.
